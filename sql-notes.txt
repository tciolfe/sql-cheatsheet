*indentation isn't required, but is it helpful to develop a personal style to make it as readable as possible. 

Common operators: 
% 			= 	wildcard
_			= 	wilcard for a single character (ie '_a%')


How to use the WHERE clause: 
-acts as a filter
-uses boolean, so be careful and think about NULL values
-uses operators, such as < > IS
-uses typical keywords: OR / AND / LIKE / IN
	-OR / AND
		ie: 
			SELECT *
			FROM countries
			WHERE population < 100000 OR population IS NULL AND continent = 'Oceania'
			ORDER BY population; 
		//this returns all countries with a population less than 100000, no population value and within the Oceania continent.

	-LIKE 
		ie: 
			SELECT *
			FROM countries
			WHERE name LIKE '%island%'
			ORDER BY name;
		//this returns any country with the island in its name

	- IN 
		ie: 
			SELECT * 
			FROM countries 
			WHERE continent IN ('Europe', 'Asia')
			ORDER BY name;
		//this returns countries with continents in europe and asia

How to use COUNT: 
-typically, use COUNT(*), then use the WHERE clause to filter the information counted.
