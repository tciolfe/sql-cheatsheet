SQL notes: 

*good cheatsheets at: http://www.dofactory.com/sql/tutorial

Syntax overview: 

		Sweaty		=	SELECT
		Feet 		=	FROM
		Will		= 	WHERE
		Give 		= 	GROUP BY 
		Horrible 	= 	HAVING
		Odors		= 	ORDER BY

		*indentation isn't required, but is it helpful to develop a personal style to make it as readable as possible. 

	Think: 

		SELECT 		= 	field(s)
		FROM 		= 	tables
		JOIN 		=	oher tables
		WHERE 		=	criteria
		GROUP BY 	=	any groups
		HAVING		=	filters for grouped values
		ORDER BY 	= 	sort order

Common operators: 
	% 			= 	wildcard
	_			= 	wilcard for a single character (ie '_a%')


How to use the WHERE clause: 
	-acts as a filter
	-uses boolean, so be careful and think about NULL values
	-uses operators, such as < > IS
	-uses typical keywords: OR / AND / LIKE / IN
		-OR / AND
			ie: 
				SELECT *
				FROM countries
				WHERE population < 100000 OR population IS NULL AND continent = 'Oceania'
				ORDER BY population; 
			//this returns all countries with a population less than 100000, no population value and within the Oceania continent.

		-LIKE 
			ie: 
				SELECT *
				FROM countries
				WHERE name LIKE '%island%'
				ORDER BY name;
			//this returns any country with the island in its name

		- IN 
			ie: 
				SELECT * 
				FROM countries 
				WHERE continent IN ('Europe', 'Asia')
				ORDER BY name;
			//this returns countries with continents in europe and asia

How to use SELECT DISTINCT statement: 
	-SELECT DISTINCT statement sorts the results and removes the duplicates
	-can use it with one column or multiple, but typically just within one column
		- ONE
			ie: 
				SELECT DISTINCT continent
				FROM countries;
			//will return a list of all the distinct continents

		-TWO or more 
			ie: 
				SELECT DISTINCT continent, population 
				FROM countries;
			//will return a list of all the continents and distinct populations
			//*Need to be careful using two together. 

How to use GROUP BY: 
	-used to order your results 
	-it groups results before calling the function 
	-


How to use ORDER BY: 
	-used to sort results
	-can also make the ordering more specific by using DESC and ASC (although, ASC is the default order by)
		-can order on multiple columns and with specifity
			ie: 
				SELECT name, continent, region
				FROM countries
				ORDER BY continent DESC, region , name;
			//this returns the continents in descending order (first), followed by the regions in ascending order (second), and the names in ascending order (third)

How to use COUNT: 
	-typically, use COUNT(*), then use the WHERE clause to filter the information counted. 
	-if you want to count values, they have to be grouped using GROUP BY. 
	-can also count particular fields COUNT(last_name)
	-DISTINCT is useful with COUNT 
		ie: 
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT last_name)
		//Will show all the distinct last names in database


What are CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS?:
	-  		


Using JOINS:
	what are JOINS?:
	-joins are used to get results from two or more tables that are linked my some form of unique ID

	SEE IMAGE: http://www.dofactory.com/Images/sql-joins.png

	types of JOINS: 
	-there are two types of joins: INNER and OUTER
	-INNER joins are the default and most common type of joins. they happen when using the join keyword on its own. 
		-results from an INNER join returns the rows from each table where the join condition is met
	-there are also multiple OUTER joins:LEFT OUTER joins, RIGHT OUTER joins and FULL OUTER joins.
		-LEFT OUTER: includes all the rows where there join condition is met AND all the rows from the left table
		-RIGHT OUTER: includes all the rows where there join condition is met AND all the rows from the right table
			-*many programs don't support a right join
		-FULL OUTER: includes all the rows from both tables, including the rows were the join condition is met

	JOIN syntax: 

		SELECT column-names
			FROM table-name1 
				JOIN table-name2 
				ON column-name1 = column-name2
		WHERE condition


	JOINs example: 

		--------------------------------------------

		table 1:customers

			CustomerID	CustomerName	City
			1 			name1			Toronto
			2			name2			Halifax
			3			name3			Montreal
			4			name4			Vancouver

		--------------------------------------------

		table 2:orders

			OrderID		CustomerID		EmployeeID
			10387		2				AA
			10388		7				AB
			10389		12				AC
			10390		4				AD

		--------------------------------------------

		INNER join syntax: this will return only the results that meet the join condition. it uses just the join clause. 

			SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.orderID
			FROM customers
				INNER JOIN orders
				ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
			ORDER BY Customers.Customer.Name;	


		RESULTS: 

			CustomerName	OrderID
			name2			10387
			name4			10390


		--------------------------------------------

		LEFT OUTER join syntax: this will return the results that meet the join condition AND all the results on the left table.

			SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
			FROM Customers
				LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders
				ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
			ORDER BY Customers.Customer.Name;

		RESULTS: 

			CustomerName	OrderID
			name1			NULL
			name2			10387
			name3			NULL
			name4			10390


		--------------------------------------------

		RIGHT OUTER join: 

			SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
			FROM Customers
				RIGHT OUTER JOIN Orders
				ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
			ORDER BY Customers.Customer.Name;

		RESULTS: 

			CustomerName	OrderID
			name2			10387
			NULL			10388
			NULL			10389
			name4			10390

		--------------------------------------------

		FULL OUTER join: 

			SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
			FROM Customers
				FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
				ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
			ORDER BY Customers.Customer.Name;

		RESULTS: 

			CustomerName	OrderID
			name1			NULL
			name2			10387
			name3			NULL
			name4			10390
			NULL			10388
			NULL 			10389
